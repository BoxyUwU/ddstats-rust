# DDSTATS-RUST

Hello gamers, I have included an install script for any distro here so running the following command should just install it

$ sh linux_install.sh

and to open it you just run the ddstats-rust command in the terminal

## Arch based distros

you should forego the binary install and just grab one of the packages from the AUR:

ddstats-rust-bin -> latest stable release as a binary
ddstats-rust-git -> latest git version

## Config File

The config file is created automatically in your config home ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME / defaults to ~/.config) on open or on install on open or on install.
